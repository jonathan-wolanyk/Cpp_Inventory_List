# A C++/Python Program to Help Small Businesses With Inventory

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:**<br/>
&emsp; This project was designed to further a developer's skills in taking files as input as well as integrating additional languages into a program. Specifically, this project integrates Python into C++. The problem presented was that a grocery store was seeking to better understand their inventory and sales. The initial task was to develop a program that would intake a list of grocery items sold in a single day and manipulate the data to help the owners better understand their customers and products. By using this program, a small business owner will better understand which items to purchase in greater quantities from their supplier to avoid running into supply chain issues. The owners may also draw conclusions as to which products they should buy less of, or eliminate from their offering.

**What did you do particularly well?** <br/>
&emsp; I believe I performed well when designing the layout of the program. Users can easily see the data that is being presented and draw conclusions from said data. The menu screen is quite concise and easy to interpret as well. The user experience is quite important when it comes to software that clients will directly interact with so I wanted to ensure that prospective users would feel as though the program was easy to use and interpret.

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**<br/>
&emsp; If I were to enhance the code in this repository, I would begin by allowing a user to input their own figures. This would allow a business owner to manipulate the data and generate their own reports. In other words, I would allow for more user input and for the program to write its search results to a separate file. This would make my code more interactive and solve more problems for the client.

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**<br/>
&emsp; The most challenging piece of code to write was the portion that generated a text-based histogram. In the past, I have used Python's matplotlib module to generate such visual displays of data. To overcome the challenge, I decided to make a horizontal histogram rather than a vertical histogram. This makes sense to the user while reducing the chance of errors in spacing or alignment. In the future, I would continue to implement graphs using a module because it is much more efficient than drafting and implementing a text-based display of information.
    
**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**<br/>
&emsp; The most transferable skill from this project is the ability to integrate other languages into a program. This is a very important skill to have when developing programs that deal with data in a variety of ways; Python is great with handling large amounts of information in various forms, while C++ is ideal for efficiency and object-oriented programming.

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**<br/>
&emsp; This program is fairly easy to maintain, since the code can receive input from any text file that has line-based inventory. It is easy to read, since each option the user can make is clearly outlined in the main menu and the search option. The program is adaptable because clients are able to include various text files in the file folder for the program to interpret. If one was to enhance the program, the next best step to enhance adaptability would be to include the ability for users to enter in their data manually.
